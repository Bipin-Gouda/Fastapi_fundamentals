1. When creating route with parameter
    - make sure the parameter name is same across operation and function

2. When type not specified
    Code:
        @app.get('/blog/{id}')         
        def blog(id):
            return {'data':id}

        output: {"data":"10"}   

    Comments:
        - "output id is a string as we get string from the URL, but we wanted an integer"
        - we convert the string to integer by specifying type

3. Need to take care of the Order of dynamic routed operators

        @app.get('/blog/{id}')         
        def show(id: int):
            # fetch blog with id = id
            return {'data':id}

        @app.get('/blog/unpublished')
        def unpublished():
            return {'data':'all unpublished blogs'}

        OUTPUT: (ERROR) - path 1 should be below path 2
            Upon accessing the path '/blog/unpublished' we get an error b/c flask executes everything line by line
            so first it will execute  @app.get('/blog/{id}') and in case of "id" it will get "unpublished" (a string)
            so it will give ERROR. 
            - SO we will have to keep such dynamic routing paths below the other dependent paths in Code.
